# ECE 581 Project 1
## Chuck Faber and Chris Mersman
For this assignment we were assigned 8 problems.

The SystemVerilog coding problems are labeled `project1_n.sv` where n is the problem number.

Problem 1 was not a coding problem but the solutions to these questions are in the `Project1Report.pdf` file.

For problem 4, we were asked to generate a log file. This is named `p1_4.log` in this directory.
